# TaikoLang
TaikoLang is a Brainf*ck-based esoteric programming language using Taiko no Tatsujin (太鼓の達人) maps.

## Language Design
TaikoLang consists of eight commands, listed below. Scripts written in TaikoLang is interchangeable with equivalent Brainf*ck scripts. Each command is 3 notes long, regardless of timing and spacing. All sliders and spinners will be omitted.

### Storage
- A single array of 32,768 cells, each having a boundary of [0, 255]. This boundary is equivalent to the `unsigned char` type in C/C++.
- A data pointer, having a soft boundary of [0, 32767]. However, the value of the data pointer is commonly stored as an `int` type.

### Commands
| Command | Conventional Taiko Notation | Brainfuck Equivalent | Function |
| ------- | --------------------------- | -------------------- | -------- |
| 🔴🔴🔴 | `ddd` | `>` | Increment the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the right). |
| 🔴🔴🔵 | `ddk` | `<` | Decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left). |
| 🔴🔵🔴 | `dkd` | `+` | Increment (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer. |
| 🔴🔵🔵 | `dkk` | `-` | Decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the data pointer. |
| 🔵🔴🔴 | `kdd` | `.` | Output the byte at the data pointer. |
| 🔵🔴🔵 | `kdk` | `,` | Accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer. |
| 🔵🔵🔴 | `kkd` | `[` | If the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching `]` command. |
| 🔵🔵🔵 | `kkk` | `]` | If the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching `[` command. |

### Note
- All array cells and the data pointer value wraps around upon incrementation or decrementation.
- For the text-based expression of TaikoLang, `d`, `k`, `D`, `K` is the only valid characters. Other characters including whitespaces, parentheses, and numbers will be omitted.
- If the total note count is not divisible by 3, the final notes will be omitted as they would not be able to construct a valid 3-note command.

## Examples
### Hello, World!

#### Output
`Hello, World!`

#### In Brainf*ck
The TaikoLang code is equivalent to the following Brainf*ck script:
```
++++++++++
[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]
>++.
>+.
+++++++..
+++.
>++++++++++++++.
------------.
<<+++++++++++++++.
